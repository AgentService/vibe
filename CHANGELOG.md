  - Removed: Benchmark panel, quick benchmark buttons, full suite functionality
  - Kept: FPS display and basic performance stats in debug overlay
  - Cleaned: All F7/B key bindings for benchmark operations removed
  - Updated: HUD simplified to show only essential controls

### Changed
- **Logger Migration**: Completed migration of all print statements to centralized Logger system
  - **Main systems**: Arena.gd, Main.gd, CardPicker.gd, CardSystem.gd, XpSystem.gd migrated
  - **Strategic logging**: Added warning logs for pool exhaustion in AbilitySystem and WaveDirector
  - **Error tracking**: Added failure logging for damage system pool lookups
  - **Category organization**: UI interactions use "ui" category, player events use "player" category
  - **Default DEBUG level**: All systems now use Logger with DEBUG level by default for development
  - **Cleaned debug output**: Removed specific alive projectiles/enemies counter logs from Arena
  - **Abilities category**: Added to log config for projectile and ability system logging

### Fixed
- **Enemy Sprite Consistency**: Fixed sprites changing colors between purple and green slimes during gameplay
  - **Root cause**: Sprite pool reusing AnimatedSprite2D nodes between different enemy types without proper reconfiguration
  - **Fix**: Added enemy type metadata tracking to sprites, ensuring proper reconfiguration when enemy type changes
  - **Implementation**: `sprite.set_meta("configured_enemy_type", enemy_type)` tracks which type each sprite is configured for
  - **Result**: Sprites maintain correct appearance throughout lifetime, no more color bleeding between enemy types
- **Extended Pause Lag Burst**: Fixed lag spikes when resuming after extended pause during level up
  - **Root cause**: RunManager._accumulator and Arena.spawn_timer continued accumulating time during pause
  - **Fix**: Added pause state checks to prevent time accumulation in RunManager._process() and Arena._process()
  - **Result**: Smooth resume regardless of pause duration, no more combat step bursts after card selection
- **Hotkey Menu Display**: Fixed empty keybinds overlay not showing text entries
  - **Root cause**: RichTextLabel with BBCode wasn't displaying properly in .tscn format
  - **Fix**: Changed to programmatic text setting with proper BBCode formatting
  - **Result**: Keybinds overlay now properly displays colored hotkey text
- **F8 Key Conflict**: Resolved F8 key causing game to close unexpectedly
  - **Root cause**: Conflicting F8 handlers between Arena and HUD systems
  - **Fix**: Removed duplicate F8 handlers, consolidated to F7 for performance menu
  - **Result**: F7 now consistently opens performance menu without crashes
- **Performance Results Display**: Fixed benchmark results not appearing after 30s test completion
  - **Root cause**: Button handlers not awaiting async benchmark completion
  - **Fix**: Made button handlers async and properly await benchmark results
  - **Result**: Results now display immediately after benchmark completion

  - **Control documentation**: Updated all hotkey displays to show new combat controls
- **Pre-commit Hook Execution Error**: Fixed git pre-commit hook failing with "No such file or directory"

  - **Path resolution fix**: Updated hook to use absolute paths from project root instead of relative paths
  - **Manual execution fix**: Updated help text to show correct command paths for manual architecture validation
  - **Developer experience**: Pre-commit hooks now execute reliably without path-related failures
  
- **Godot Headless Console Output**: Resolved issue preventing console output from appearing in headless test execution
  - **Root cause**: Test scripts extending `Node` instead of `SceneTree` when run with `--script` flag
  - **Script lifecycle fix**: Changed from `_ready()` to `_initialize()` method for proper SceneTree execution
  - **Autoload dependency solution**: Documented scene-based testing (`.tscn`) vs raw script testing patterns
  - **Documentation update**: Added console output patterns and command examples to CLAUDE.md Testing section
  - **Validation patterns**: Clear distinction between simple scripts and tests requiring singleton access

- **Testing Documentation Enhancement**: Updated CLAUDE.md to prevent autoload access errors during test development
  - **Clear autoload rule**: If test needs EventBus, RNG, ContentDB, or any autoload → use .tscn scene, NOT raw .gd script
  - **Workflow examples**: Added correct/wrong command patterns with concrete examples in workflow section
  - **Error prevention**: Documentation now prevents "test script doesn't have access to autoloads" implementation errors
