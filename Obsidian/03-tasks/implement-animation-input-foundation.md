# Animation-to-Input Foundation for Future Ability System

**Status:** üìã Ready to Start  
**Priority:** High  
**Type:** Foundation Architecture  
**Created:** 2025-09-12  
**Context:** Foundation layer for ABILITY-1 modular ability system - creates input‚Üíanimation mapping that future AbilityService will build upon

## Overview

Implement the essential input-to-animation foundation that bridges current character animations with future modular ability system. This task creates the interface layer that ABILITY-1's AbilityService will eventually hook into, ensuring seamless architectural evolution.

**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ PlayerRanger has complete animation sets: bow, magic, spear (all 4 directions)
- ‚úÖ Equipment synchronization working properly  
- ‚úÖ HUD AbilityBarComponent exists with 4 slots + cooldown system
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing input detection for new abilities (RMB, Q key)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No connection between new animations and HUD ability bar

**Target State:**
- ‚úÖ RMB triggers bow animations with proper directional support
- ‚úÖ Q key triggers magic/spear animations with proper directional support
- ‚úÖ Spacebar dash integrated with ability bar (currently just roll)
- ‚úÖ HUD ability bar shows cooldowns when abilities are used
- ‚úÖ All new abilities emit proper EventBus signals
- ‚úÖ Architecture ready for future AbilityService integration

## Architecture Alignment

### Foundation for ABILITY-1 Modular System

This implementation creates the exact foundation that the future modular ability system requires:

```gdscript
// Current Target: Direct input ‚Üí animation
Input.is_action_just_pressed("cast_bow") ‚Üí _play_animation("bow_down") ‚Üí HUD cooldown

// Future ABILITY-1: Same input ‚Üí modular system
Input.is_action_just_pressed("cast_bow") ‚Üí AbilityService.cast("bow_shot", ctx) ‚Üí modules ‚Üí animation
```

### Input Layer Compatibility
- Input bindings established now will be reused by AbilityService
- HUD cooldown system becomes ability feedback mechanism  
- EventBus signals become ability system communication layer
- Animation state management becomes ability execution feedback

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Input Detection Extension

**File:** `scenes/arena/Player.gd`

Add input handling in `_physics_process()`:
```gdscript
# New ability inputs
if Input.is_action_just_pressed("cast_bow") and not is_bow_attacking:
    _handle_bow_attack()
if Input.is_action_just_pressed("cast_magic") and not is_magic_casting:
    _handle_magic_cast()
# Spacebar dash already exists as roll - integrate with ability bar
```

### 2. Animation State Management

**New state variables:**
```gdscript
var is_bow_attacking: bool = false
var bow_attack_timer: float = 0.0
var is_magic_casting: bool = false  
var magic_cast_timer: float = 0.0
var is_spear_attacking: bool = false
var spear_attack_timer: float = 0.0
```

### 3. Animation Integration

**Extend `_play_animation()` for new types:**
- `bow_[direction]` animations with proper timing
- `magic_[direction]` animations with casting duration
- `spear_[direction]` animations with attack timing
- Maintain equipment layer synchronization

### 4. HUD Ability Bar Connection

**Map to 4-slot ability bar:**
- Slot 1: Primary Attack (LMB) - existing melee
- Slot 2: Bow Attack (RMB) - new  
- Slot 3: Dash (Spacebar) - existing roll, integrate cooldown
- Slot 4: Magic/Spear (Q) - new

**AbilityBarComponent Integration:**
- Connect input events to `ability_triggered` signals
- Implement proper cooldown timings
- Update ability names and hotkey labels

### 5. EventBus Signal System

**Add new signals to `autoload/EventBus.gd`:**
```gdscript
signal bow_attack_started(payload: Dictionary)
signal magic_cast_started(payload: Dictionary) 
signal spear_attack_started(payload: Dictionary)
signal ability_cooldown_started(ability_id: String, duration: float)
```

### 6. Input Map Configuration

**Project Settings ‚Üí Input Map:**
- `cast_bow` ‚Üí Right Mouse Button
- `cast_magic` ‚Üí Q key  
- `dash` ‚Üí Spacebar (already exists as `ui_accept`)

## Testing Requirements

### Animation Testing
- [ ] All 4 directional bow animations trigger correctly
- [ ] All 4 directional magic animations trigger correctly  
- [ ] All 4 directional spear animations trigger correctly
- [ ] Equipment layers stay synchronized during new animations
- [ ] Animation states prevent overlap (no bow while magic casting)

### Input Testing  
- [ ] RMB triggers bow attack in correct direction
- [ ] Q key triggers magic cast in correct direction
- [ ] Spacebar dash works and shows cooldown in ability bar
- [ ] Input events properly detected during movement

### HUD Integration Testing
- [ ] Ability bar slots show correct ability names
- [ ] Cooldowns activate when abilities are used
- [ ] Hotkey labels display correctly (LMB, RMB, SPACE, Q)
- [ ] Visual feedback for abilities on cooldown

### Architecture Testing
- [ ] EventBus signals emit with proper payload structure
- [ ] No direct node dependencies (signals only)
- [ ] Hot-reload friendly (F5 works without issues)
- [ ] Performance stable during rapid ability usage

## Future Migration Path

When ABILITY-1 modular system is implemented:

1. **Input layer stays identical** - same key bindings, same detection
2. **Replace direct animation calls** with `AbilityService.cast(ability_id, context)`
3. **Reuse HUD system** - AbilityService hooks into existing cooldown display
4. **Expand EventBus signals** - add module-specific events
5. **Maintain animation integration** - AbilityService triggers same animations

**Zero breaking changes** to user experience or input handling.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Input Detection
1. Add input actions to Input Map
2. Implement input detection in Player.gd  
3. Add animation state variables and timers
4. Test basic input‚Üíanimation flow

### Phase 2: Animation Integration  
1. Extend `_play_animation()` for new ability types
2. Implement proper animation timing and state management
3. Ensure equipment layer synchronization  
4. Test all directional animations

### Phase 3: HUD Connection
1. Update AbilityBarComponent ability definitions
2. Connect input events to ability bar triggers
3. Implement cooldown integration
4. Update hotkey labels and ability names

### Phase 4: EventBus Integration
1. Add new ability signals to EventBus
2. Emit signals from Player ability methods
3. Test signal payloads and timing
4. Document signal contracts

### Phase 5: Testing & Polish
1. Comprehensive animation testing
2. HUD integration validation  
3. Performance testing
4. Architecture alignment verification

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Input Mapping**: RMB‚Üíbow, Q‚Üímagic, Spacebar‚Üídash all working
- [ ] **Animations**: All new abilities show correct directional animations  
- [ ] **Equipment Sync**: All equipment layers animate together properly
- [ ] **HUD Integration**: Ability bar shows cooldowns and correct labels
- [ ] **EventBus**: All abilities emit proper signals with payload data
- [ ] **Architecture**: Foundation ready for AbilityService integration
- [ ] **Performance**: No frame drops or animation stuttering
- [ ] **User Experience**: Smooth, responsive ability usage

## File Touch List

**Modified:**
- `scenes/arena/Player.gd` - Input detection, animation states, ability methods
- `autoload/EventBus.gd` - New ability signals  
- `scenes/ui/hud/components/core/AbilityBarComponent.gd` - Ability definitions update
- Project Settings Input Map - New input actions

**Potentially Modified:**
- `scripts/systems/PlayerAttackHandler.gd` - Integration with new abilities
- `scenes/arena/Arena.gd` - Input routing (if needed)

**Testing Files:**
- Create isolated test scene for ability animation testing
- Add test cases for HUD integration
- Performance testing during rapid ability usage

## Notes

This foundation task is **essential preparation** for the modular ability system. It establishes the input-animation-HUD pipeline that future abilities will use, ensuring architectural consistency and smooth migration path.

The implementation maintains full compatibility with existing systems while creating the interface layer that AbilityService will eventually manage. No rework will be needed when the modular system is implemented.
