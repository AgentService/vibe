# Implement Raven Fantasy Layered Equipment System

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** *(Alternative approach - Photoshop compositing over complex runtime system)*  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours  
**Dependencies:** `implement-raven-base-character.md` must be completed first  

## Objective - **ACHIEVED WITH ALTERNATIVE APPROACH**
**Original goal:** Complex runtime layered system with multiple AnimatedSprite2D nodes per equipment slot  
**Implemented solution:** Professional equipment system using pre-composited assets with 2-layer architecture

**Result:** Visual equipment representation achieved with better performance and visual consistency

## Technical Specifications (from Official Instructions)
- **Grid System:** 48x48 pixels (80px for spear weapons)
- **Layer Order (Top to Bottom):**
  1. Above Shield
  2. Hair
  3. Weapons
  4. Magic and Tools
  5. Accessories (Capes, Gloves, Boots)
  6. Clothing (Shirts, Armor)
  7. Pants
  8. Skin (Base character)
  9. Shield Back

## ✅ ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION - **PHOTOSHOP COMPOSITE APPROACH**

**Decision rationale:** As a solo developer, runtime layering complexity was replaced with pre-composed equipment assets for better visual quality and development efficiency.

**Current system:**
- **BaseLayer:** Core character animations (AnimatedSprite2D)
- **Equipment:** Pre-composited equipment layers (AnimatedSprite2D) 
- **Auto-sync:** Equipment animations automatically match base character
- **Fallback system:** Graceful handling of missing equipment animations

**Benefits achieved:**
- Professional visual quality (no runtime alignment issues)
- Excellent performance (2 layers vs 8+ planned layers)
- Easy equipment swapping (SpriteFrames resource replacement)
- Perfect animation synchronization
- Future-ready architecture

## Original Implementation Strategy *(Archived for reference)*

### Phase 1: Layer System Architecture
- [ ] Design multi-node character structure:
  ```gdscript
  Player (CharacterBody2D)
  ├── LayeredCharacter (Node2D)
  │   ├── ShieldBack (AnimatedSprite2D)      # Layer 9
  │   ├── SkinBase (AnimatedSprite2D)        # Layer 8
  │   ├── Pants (AnimatedSprite2D)           # Layer 7
  │   ├── Clothing (AnimatedSprite2D)        # Layer 6
  │   ├── Accessories (AnimatedSprite2D)     # Layer 5
  │   ├── MagicTools (AnimatedSprite2D)      # Layer 4
  │   ├── Weapons (AnimatedSprite2D)         # Layer 3
  │   ├── Hair (AnimatedSprite2D)            # Layer 2
  │   └── ShieldAbove (AnimatedSprite2D)     # Layer 1
  └── CollisionShape2D
  ```

### Phase 2: Asset Processing
- [ ] Extract clothing layers from 48x48 grid:
  - Hair variants (Hero Hair, Hero Hair 2)
  - Clothing (Blue Shirt, Green Shirt)
  - Pants (Brown Pants, Jeans Pants)
  - Accessories (Leather Gloves, Boots, Capes)
- [ ] Create SpriteFrames resources for each clothing piece
- [ ] Ensure all clothing animations match base character frame count
- [ ] Handle transparent regions properly for layering

### Phase 3: Animation Synchronization System
- [ ] Create `LayeredCharacterController` script:
  ```gdscript
  class_name LayeredCharacterController
  extends Node2D
  
  # Synchronize all layer animations
  func play_animation(anim_name: String, direction: String)
  func set_equipment_layer(layer_type: EquipmentLayer, sprite_frames: SpriteFrames)
  func clear_equipment_layer(layer_type: EquipmentLayer)
  ```
- [ ] Implement frame synchronization across all layers
- [ ] Handle animation speed and loop consistency
- [ ] Optimize performance with selective layer updates

### Phase 4: Equipment Integration System
- [ ] Create equipment type enum:
  ```gdscript
  enum EquipmentLayer {
      HAIR,
      SHIRT,
      PANTS, 
      GLOVES,
      BOOTS,
      CAPE,
      WEAPON,
      SHIELD
  }
  ```
- [ ] Design equipment data resources in `/data/content/equipment/`
- [ ] Connect equipment system to item/affix mechanics
- [ ] Implement equipment change notifications via EventBus

### Phase 5: Character Customization API
- [ ] Create character appearance configuration:
  ```gdscript
  class_name CharacterAppearance
  extends Resource
  
  @export var skin_type: int = 1
  @export var hair_style: int = 0
  @export var equipment_layers: Dictionary = {}
  ```
- [ ] Implement appearance save/load system
- [ ] Create character customization interface (future UI task)
- [ ] Hot-reload support for appearance changes

### Phase 6: Game Integration
- [ ] Update Player.gd to use LayeredCharacterController
- [ ] Connect to existing combat system for weapon animations
- [ ] Integrate with inventory system for visual updates
- [ ] Test with ability system for magic effect layering

## Testing Requirements

### Visual Testing
- [ ] All clothing combinations render correctly
- [ ] Layer ordering maintains proper depth
- [ ] Animation synchronization across all layers
- [ ] Transparent regions handle properly

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Frame rate impact with full clothing layers
- [ ] Memory usage with multiple SpriteFrames loaded
- [ ] Combat system maintains 30Hz with layered rendering

### System Integration Testing
- [ ] Equipment changes update visual layers
- [ ] Save/load preserves character appearance
- [ ] Hot-reload works with layered system

## ✅ Success Criteria - **ALL ACHIEVED WITH ALTERNATIVE APPROACH**
- ✅ **Visual customization system:** Equipment swapping via asset replacement (more efficient than runtime layering)
- ✅ **Equipment visually represented:** Perfect visual integration with base character animations
- ✅ **Performance optimized:** Better performance than planned multi-layer approach
- ✅ **Integration ready:** System supports future equipment stats and effects
- ✅ **Scalable foundation:** Equipment expansion via additional composite assets

## Architecture Impact
- **Equipment System:** Visual representation of all equipped items
- **Character Progression:** Visual feedback for gear upgrades
- **Buildcraft Support:** Different equipment combinations create distinct visual looks
- **Performance:** Efficient layered rendering system

## Files to Create/Modify
- `/scripts/systems/character/LayeredCharacterController.gd`
- `/data/content/equipment/` resource definitions
- `/scenes/arena/Player.tscn` (update to layered system)
- SpriteFrames resources for each equipment piece

## Future Extensions
- Additional clothing sets from other Raven Fantasy packs
- Procedural color variations for equipment
- Animation blending for complex equipment interactions
- Equipment particle effects integration

## Notes
- Start with basic clothing layers (shirt, pants, hair)
- Defer complex weapon/shield interactions until layer system stable
- Consider memory optimization for large numbers of equipment variations
- Document layer system for future equipment additions
