# Enemy V2 MVP — COMPLETED

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Completion Date:** 2025-01-09  
**Owner:** Solo (Indie)  
**Original Priority:** High  
**Risk:** Low (additive behind toggle), reversible  

---

## Completion Summary

The Enemy V2 MVP has been successfully implemented with all core functionality working. The system provides:

- **Data-driven enemy creation**: Add new enemies with just .tres files
- **Boss scene system**: AnimatedSprite2D workflow for boss animation editing
- **Hybrid rendering**: MultiMesh for regular enemies, scenes for bosses
- **Deterministic variations**: RNG-based color/size/speed variations
- **Performance validated**: 500+ enemy stress testing passed
- **Zero legacy disruption**: Behind toggle with full rollback capability

---

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### Core MVP Components
- **EnemyTemplate.gd**: Complete resource schema with inheritance support via parent_path
- **EnemyFactory.gd**: Full template loading, deterministic variation generation, spawn config output
- **SpawnConfig.gd**: Bridge between V2 templates and legacy pooling system  
- **Template System**: 3 base templates + 6 variations (goblin, orc_warrior, archer, elite_knight, ancient_lich, dragon_lord)
- **V2 Integration Seam**: `WaveDirector._spawn_enemy_v2()` with guarded V2 branch (`BalanceDB.use_enemy_v2_system`)
- **BalanceDB Integration**: Added `use_enemy_v2_system` toggle and `v2_template_weights` support
- **Deterministic Variation**: RNG streams with hash-based seeding (run_id + wave_index + spawn_index)
- **Legacy Compatibility**: Zero disruption - V2 enemies use existing pooled system and MultiMesh rendering
- **Test Infrastructure**: `EnemySystem_Isolated_v2.tscn` with 500-enemy stress testing
- **Boss Scene System**: AncientLich.tscn with AnimatedSprite2D and proper Animation Panel workflow

### Boss Visual System
- **Scene-based boss spawning**: `WaveDirector._spawn_boss_scene()` routes bosses to scene instantiation
- **AnimatedSprite2D workflow**: Boss animations editable via Animation Panel in editor
- **Render tier detection**: System correctly detects `render_tier == "boss"` for hybrid rendering
- **Boss scaling**: 5x health, 2x damage scaling working via spawn config

### Validation Results
- **Performance**: 500-enemy stress test passes - MultiMesh batching intact
- **Determinism**: Fixed seeds produce identical enemy stats/colors across runs
- **Data-Driven**: Adding new enemy = 1 .tres file + weight adjustment (no code changes)
- **Boss Spawning**: Ancient lich spawns successfully with proper AnimatedSprite2D rendering
- **B Key Debug**: Manual boss spawning working for testing

### Integration Points
- **WaveDirector**: V2 integration seam with `_spawn_enemy_v2()` and `_spawn_boss_scene()`
- **BalanceDB**: Toggle system with `use_enemy_v2_system` flag
- **EnemyFactory**: Template loading, inheritance resolution, deterministic variation
- **SpawnConfig**: Bridge to existing pooling system for seamless integration

---

## Technical Achievements

### Data-Driven Enemy Creation
- Create new enemy: Just add .tres file in variations/ folder
- Inheritance system: Variations extend base templates via parent_path
- Weight-based selection: Templates include spawn weights for randomization
- No code changes required for new enemy types

### Hybrid Rendering System
- **Regular enemies**: MultiMesh pooled rendering for performance (500+ enemies)
- **Boss enemies**: Scene-based rendering with AnimatedSprite2D for visual control
- **Automatic routing**: render_tier detection in spawn system
- **Performance maintained**: No regression in regular enemy batching

### Deterministic System
- **Seeded RNG**: hash(run_id, wave_index, spawn_index) for reproducible variations
- **Color variations**: Hue shifts within defined ranges
- **Size variations**: Scale factors for visual diversity
- **Speed variations**: Movement speed jitter within bounds
- **Identical runs**: Same seed produces identical enemy spawns

### Boss Animation Workflow  
- **AnimatedSprite2D**: Full Animation Panel access in editor
- **Visual editing**: Frame-by-frame animation editing capability
- **Scene inheritance**: Boss scenes can extend base templates
- **Runtime integration**: Boss scenes receive spawn config data

## Lessons Learned

1. **Toggle-based integration** provided safe rollback during development
2. **Boss visual system** required scene-based approach vs MultiMesh for editing workflow
3. **Template inheritance** simplified enemy variant creation significantly
4. **Deterministic RNG** essential for consistent gameplay across runs
5. **Performance isolation** allowed stress testing without affecting legacy system

---

## Follow-up Work

The remaining work has been moved to **6-ENEMY_V2_ENHANCEMENTS.md** and includes:
- BaseBoss.gd base class system
- Enemy scaling system in BalanceDB
- ArenaConfig spawn plan integration
- SpawnDirector for phase-based spawning
- Data-driven spawn scheduling

---

## Impact

This implementation establishes the foundation for:
- **Rapid enemy creation**: Artists/designers can add enemies without programmer involvement
- **Rich boss experiences**: Full Animation Panel workflow for complex boss animations
- **Scalable enemy system**: Template inheritance supports unlimited enemy variations
- **Performance maintenance**: MultiMesh rendering preserved for regular enemies
- **Future expansion**: Clean architecture enables advanced features (DoT, AoE, effects)

The Enemy V2 MVP successfully delivers on its core promise: **adding new enemies requires only .tres file creation with no code changes**.
