# Ability System Module Design

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ **TODO**  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Type**: System Architecture  
**Created**: 2025-08-23  
**Context**: Extract abilities from Arena system and create dedicated module


## Overview

Create a dedicated ability system module separate from the Arena system for better organization, maintainability, and editor workflow. The current system has abilities mixed into Arena.gd which makes it harder to manage and expand.

## Core Concepts

### System Separation
- Extract ability logic from Arena.gd into dedicated AbilityModule
- Keep Arena as rendering/scene management only  
- Clear separation of concerns between systems

### Ability Definition Approaches
- **Option A**: JSON-based definitions (current approach, AI-friendly)
- **Option B**: .tres resources (type-safe, inspector-friendly)  
- **Option C**: Hybrid - simple abilities in JSON, complex ones in .tres
- **Option D**: GDScript classes for abilities (most flexible, hardest to edit)

### Editor Workflow Ideas
- In-game ability editor for rapid prototyping
- Visual node-based ability designer
- Template system for common ability patterns
- Hot-reload for ability tweaking during gameplay
- Ability preview/testing mode

### Data Structure Concepts
```
Ability {
  - id, name, description
  - damage/healing values
  - cooldown, range, area_of_effect
  - projectile_config (if ranged)
  - visual_effects
  - sound_effects
  - upgrade_paths
  - trigger_conditions
}


```


### Integration Points
- Player input handling
- Combat system integration
- Visual effects system
- Audio system
- UI/HUD updates
- Card system (for upgrades)

## Potential Benefits
- **Modularity**: Easy to add/remove/modify abilities
- **Testability**: Isolated system for balance testing
- **Scalability**: Support for many abilities without bloating Arena
- **Maintainability**: Clear ownership and responsibility
- **Moddability**: Easier for external content creation

## Research Questions
- How to handle ability interactions/combinations?
- What's the best data format for ability definitions?  
- How to make abilities easy to balance and tweak?
- Should abilities be stateful or stateless?
- How to handle complex ability behaviors (chains, conditions, etc.)?

## Related Systems
- Combat/Damage system
- Card system (ability upgrades)
- Player progression
- Visual effects
- Audio system

**Next Steps:**
1. Research existing ability systems in similar games
2. Prototype different data definition approaches
3. Design the core AbilityModule interface
4. Plan migration strategy from current system
