# Fullscreen Scene Manager

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ **Planning**  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Type**: UI Framework Core  
**Created**: 2025-09-10  
**Context**: Implement centralized management system for fullscreen scenes like main menu, settings, character selection, and other scene-based UIs

## Overview

Create a robust scene management system that handles transitions between fullscreen UI scenes while maintaining performance, state management, and consistent visual design. This system will complement the modal/overlay system by managing scenes that require complete screen real estate.

## Research-Based Architecture Decisions

### Scene Hierarchy Strategy
- **Layer 50**: Full Screen Overlays (main menu, settings, character select)
- **Transition System**: Smooth scene transitions with loading states
- **State Persistence**: Maintain application state across scene changes
- **Resource Management**: Efficient scene loading/unloading for memory optimization

### Scene Categories
1. **Menu Scenes**: Main menu, settings, options, credits
2. **Selection Scenes**: Character select, game mode selection, map selection
3. **Result Scenes**: End-of-run results, statistics, progression summary
4. **System Scenes**: Loading screens, error screens, maintenance modes

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Scene Management Framework
**Timeline**: Week 1-2

#### Scene Manager Autoload
- [ ] Create `SceneManager.gd` - centralized scene transition coordinator
- [ ] Implement scene stack management with history tracking
- [ ] Add scene preloading system for smooth transitions
- [ ] Create scene state persistence system

```gdscript
# SceneManager.gd - Autoload
extends Node

var scene_stack: Array[String] = []
var current_scene: Node = null
var loading_scene: PackedScene = preload("res://scenes/ui/system/LoadingScreen.tscn")
var scene_cache: Dictionary = {}

func change_scene(scene_path: String, transition_type: String = "fade") -> void
func push_scene(scene_path: String) -> void  # Add to stack
func pop_scene() -> void  # Return to previous scene
func preload_scene(scene_path: String) -> void
```

### EventBus Extensions
```gdscript
# Scene management signals
signal scene_change_requested(scene_path: String, data: Dictionary)
signal scene_loaded(scene_name: String)
signal scene_unloaded(scene_name: String)
signal transition_started(from_scene: String, to_scene: String)
signal transition_completed(scene_name: String)

# Scene-specific signals
signal main_menu_action(action: String)  # play_game, settings, quit
signal character_selected(character_data: Dictionary)
signal game_mode_selected(mode: String, settings: Dictionary)
signal settings_changed(category: String, setting: String, value: Variant)
signal run_results_acknowledged()
```

### Scene Communication Pattern
```gdscript
# Example: CharacterSelectScene.gd
extends BaseFullscreenScene

@export var character_preview: CharacterPreview
@export var stats_panel: StatsPanel
@export var build_list: BuildList

func _ready():
    super._ready()
    EventBus.character_data_loaded.connect(_on_character_data_loaded)
    character_preview.character_selected.connect(_on_character_selected)

func _on_character_selected(character_data: Dictionary):
    EventBus.character_selected.emit(character_data)
    SceneManager.change_scene("res://scenes/ui/fullscreen/selection/GameModeSelectScene.tscn")

func _on_back_button_pressed():
    SceneManager.pop_scene()  # Return to main menu
```

## Performance Optimization Strategy

### Scene Loading Optimization
- **Preloading**: Preload next likely scenes during idle time
- **Scene Caching**: Keep frequently used scenes in memory
- **Resource Streaming**: Stream large assets progressively
- **Dependency Management**: Load shared resources once

### Memory Management
- **Scene Cleanup**: Proper resource cleanup on scene change
- **Texture Management**: Optimize scene background textures
- **Audio Management**: Stream scene music and sounds
- **Cache Limits**: Implement LRU cache for scene resources

### Transition Performance
- **GPU Transitions**: Use shaders for smooth transitions
- **Async Loading**: Load scenes asynchronously during transitions
- **Frame Budget**: Limit expensive operations during transitions
- **Interruption Handling**: Handle rapid scene changes gracefully

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All fullscreen scenes implemented with consistent navigation
- [ ] Smooth scene transitions with <200ms response time
- [ ] Proper state persistence across scene changes
- [ ] Scene preloading working without impacting current scene performance

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Scene loading time <1 second for all scenes
- [ ] Memory usage optimization with proper cleanup
- [ ] Transition animations at consistent 60+ FPS
- [ ] No memory leaks during scene cycling

### User Experience Requirements
- [ ] Intuitive navigation flow between scenes
- [ ] Consistent visual design across all fullscreen scenes
- [ ] Responsive controls with proper feedback
- [ ] Graceful handling of navigation edge cases

## Integration Dependencies

### Required Systems
- **SceneManager** (new autoload)
- **TransitionManager** (new system)
- **Theme System** - consistent styling across scenes
- **EventBus** - scene communication and state management

### Data Integration
- **CharacterManager** - character data for selection scenes
- **SettingsManager** - persistent configuration
- **AchievementSystem** - unlock status and progression
- **StatisticsTracker** - game statistics and leaderboards

### External Dependencies
- **AudioManager** - scene-specific music and sound effects
- **InputManager** - input handling across different scenes
- **SaveSystem** - state persistence and player progress
- **LocalizationSystem** - multi-language support

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk: Scene Loading Performance
- **Mitigation**: Implement scene preloading and resource caching
- **Monitoring**: Real-time loading time tracking in debug builds
- **Testing**: Performance testing with various hardware configurations

### Medium Risk: State Management Complexity
- **Mitigation**: Clear state ownership rules and comprehensive testing
- **Architecture**: Well-defined data flow patterns between scenes
- **Testing**: State persistence testing with complex navigation flows

### Medium Risk: Memory Leaks
- **Mitigation**: Strict resource cleanup protocols and automated testing
- **Tools**: Memory profiling integration for scene transitions
- **Testing**: Extended scene cycling tests for memory leak detection

This fullscreen scene management system will provide smooth navigation between major game screens while maintaining performance and state consistency throughout the application.
