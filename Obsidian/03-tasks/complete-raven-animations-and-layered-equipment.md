# Complete Raven Fantasy Animations & Layered Equipment System

**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ Ready to Start  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours  
**Dependencies:** Raven Fantasy base character implemented (Phase 1-3 complete)

## Current Status
âœ… **Completed:**
- Raven asset organization in `/assets/sprites/raven_character/`
- PlayerRanger.tscn scene creation and integration
- Character selection system integration (ranger class)
- PlayerSpawner dynamic scene loading
- Core animations: idle, walk, run (all directions)
- Arena combat integration with melee attacks
- Enhanced ranger stats (75 HP, 30 damage, 1.2 speed)

## Objective
Complete the remaining Raven Fantasy animations and implement the layered equipment system to enable visual character customization and PoE-style buildcraft representation.

## Phase 1: Complete Animation Set (1-2 hours)

### Missing Core Animations
- [ ] **Combat Animations:**
  - Strike 01, Strike 02 (melee combat variations)
  - Bow animations (ranged combat - perfect for ranger!)
  - Magic/Conjure (spell casting)
- [ ] **Utility Animations:**
  - Dodge (combat mobility)
  - Jump, Climb (terrain navigation)
  - Death/Hurt animations
- [ ] **Tool Animations:**
  - Pickaxe, Shovel, Hoe (farming/gathering)
  - Fishing, Watering Can (resource collection)

### Animation Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Extract remaining animations from `Full.png` using AtlasTexture regions
- [ ] Update `raven_ranger_frames.tres` with new animations
- [ ] Configure appropriate frame timing and loop settings
- [ ] Test animation transitions and state machine integration
- [ ] Verify compatibility with existing combat and movement systems

## Phase 2: Layered Equipment System (2-3 hours)

### Equipment Foundation
- [ ] **Analyze Adventurer Set structure** (`/assets/sprites/Raven Fantasy - Pixelart Top Down Character - Adventurer Set/`)
  - Blue/Green Shirts (torso layer)
  - Brown/Jeans Pants (legs layer)
  - Leather Boots/Gloves (feet/hands layers)
  - Adventurer Capes (back layer)
  - Hero Hair variants (head layer)

### Layer System Architecture
- [ ] **Design equipment layer structure:**
  ```
  PlayerRanger
  â”œâ”€â”€ BaseCharacter (AnimatedSprite2D - naked Raven)
  â”œâ”€â”€ Equipment Layers:
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ BackLayer (capes, wings)
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ TorsoLayer (shirts, armor)
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ LegsLayer (pants, skirts)
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ FeetLayer (boots, shoes)
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ HandsLayer (gloves, gauntlets)
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ HeadLayer (hair, hats, helmets)
  ```

### Equipment Resource System
- [ ] **Create Equipment resource classes:**
  - `EquipmentItem.gd` (base class)
  - `EquipmentType.gd` (categories: torso, legs, etc.)
  - `EquipmentDatabase.gd` (item registry)
- [ ] **Equipment slot management:**
  - Character equipment state
  - Visual layer synchronization
  - Animation frame matching across layers

### Visual Integration
- [ ] **Layer animation synchronization:**
  - Ensure all equipment layers match base character animations
  - Handle frame timing across multiple AnimatedSprite2D nodes
  - Maintain visual cohesion during movement/combat
- [ ] **Equipment preview system:**
  - Character select equipment preview
  - Inventory/equipment screen visualization
  - Real-time equipment swapping

## Phase 3: Integration & Testing (30 minutes)

### System Integration
- [ ] **Character creation enhancement:**
  - Add starting equipment selection to character creation
  - Integrate with existing character profile system
  - Update character-types.tres with equipment defaults

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] **Visual validation:**
  - All animation combinations work correctly
  - Equipment layers render in proper order
  - No visual artifacts or misalignment
- [ ] **Performance testing:**
  - Multiple AnimatedSprite2D performance impact
  - Memory usage with equipment combinations
  - Frame rate stability in arena with multiple enemies
- [ ] **System compatibility:**
  - Hot-reload compatibility with existing patterns
  - Save/load equipment state persistence
  - Character manager integration

## Success Criteria
- [ ] **Animation Completeness:** All 15+ Raven Fantasy animations implemented and functional
- [ ] **Layered Equipment:** Visual equipment system working with at least 3-4 equipment pieces
- [ ] **Character Distinctiveness:** Rangers visually distinct from Knights through both base character and equipment
- [ ] **Performance Maintained:** No regression in combat or UI performance
- [ ] **Foundation Ready:** Architecture supports future equipment expansion and PoE-style buildcraft

## Technical Specifications
- **Animation Grid:** Continue using 48x48 pixel frames from `Full.png`
- **Equipment Grid:** Match 48x48 grid from Adventurer Set assets
- **Layer Management:** Z-index based layer ordering
- **Resource Pattern:** Follow existing `.tres` resource patterns for equipment
- **Hot-reload:** Maintain F5 compatibility for rapid iteration

## Architecture Impact
- **Enhanced Character System:** Multi-class support with visual customization
- **Equipment Foundation:** Enables future gear progression and visual builds
- **PoE-style Buildcraft:** Visual representation of character builds through equipment
- **Scalable Design:** Framework for additional character classes and equipment types

## Files to Create/Modify
- **Animation Updates:** `raven_ranger_frames.tres`
- **Equipment System:** 
  - `scripts/domain/EquipmentItem.gd`
  - `scripts/domain/EquipmentDatabase.gd` 
  - `scripts/systems/EquipmentManager.gd`
- **Scene Updates:** `PlayerRanger.tscn` (add equipment layers)
- **Resources:** Equipment `.tres` files in `/data/content/equipment/`

## Next Steps After Completion
1. **Advanced Combat:** Implement bow combat mechanics using ranger bow animations
2. **Equipment Progression:** Add equipment stats and gameplay effects
3. **Character Builds:** Integrate equipment with skill/build systems
4. **Additional Classes:** Extend system to support Mage or other classes

## Notes
- **Prioritize visual impact:** Focus on equipment pieces that provide clear visual distinction
- **Performance conscious:** Monitor layer rendering performance in arena scenarios
- **Future extensibility:** Design equipment system to scale with additional classes
- **Asset efficiency:** Reuse equipment across character classes where appropriate
