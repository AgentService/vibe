Status: Ready to Start
Owner: Solo (Indie)
Priority: High
Type: System Integration
Dependencies: SpawnDirector (âœ… working), MapConfig (âœ… working), MapLevel (âœ… working)
Risk: Medium-Low (builds on proven foundations)
Complexity: MVP=3/10, Full=6/10

## Overview

Create an integrated map progression system with PoE-style events that delivers the core gameflow vision: **15-minute map cycles with dynamic scaling, strategic events, and performance-based progression.**

**Foundation:** Leverages existing SpawnDirector, MapConfig, and MapLevel systems that are already working well.

**Vision Integration:** Combines map tier progression with event-driven encounters to create the "frantically dodging swarms while growing powerful" experience with clear objectives and rewards.

**Enhancement Strategy:** Based on comprehensive multi-specialist analysis (see `Obsidian/02-brainstorm/MULTI_MIND_ENHANCEMENT_STRATEGY_2025.md`), this system integrates proven 2024-2025 engagement patterns while respecting existing architecture.

## Core Design Principles (From Brainstorming)

### Gameflow Vision
- **15-minute map cycles** with time-based tier progression
- **PoE-style events** (Breach, Pack Hunt, Ritual) as strategic objectives
- **Performance-based rewards** - skill creates faster meta progression
- **Expected failure progression** - maps scale beyond player power, failure drives meta advancement
- **Event superiority** - events always more rewarding than baseline wave farming

### Progression Philosophy
- **Dual progression**: In-run power (cards/points) + meta advancement (between runs)
- **Dynamic scaling**: Same map, difficulty scales with meta progression
- **Performance multipliers**: Better play = more XP/faster meta progression
- **Anti-gaming**: No exploitable timing strategies, events drive optimal play

### Enhancement Principles (Multi-Mind Analysis)
- **Event Mastery System**: PoE Atlas-style passive tree where players earn points from completing events
- **Transparent Synergy Systems**: Players see exact power multipliers before selection
- **Activity-Based Development**: Zone mastery through actual play patterns
- **Failure-Forward Design**: Near-miss psychology creates "just one more run" engagement
- **Flow State Management**: 3-minute intensity cycles prevent fatigue while maintaining challenge

---

## Current Foundation (âœ… Working)

### Existing Infrastructure
- **SpawnDirector**: Zone-based spawning with proximity filtering, pack formation support
- **MapLevel**: Time-based progression system with scaling multipliers
- **MapConfig**: Data-driven arena configuration with scaling parameters
- **Zone System**: Scene-based Area2D spawn zones with proper geometry detection
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Multiple scaling factors (time, wave, level, density)

### Scaling Capabilities Already Working
```gdscript
// From MapConfig.gd - fully configurable
base_spawn_scaling = {
    "time_scaling_rate": 0.1,        // 10% per minute
    "wave_scaling_rate": 0.15,       // 15% per wave
    "pack_base_size_min": 5,
    "pack_base_size_max": 10,
    "max_scaling_multiplier": 2.5
}

// From SpawnDirector.gd - working scaling integration
var level_multiplier = MapLevel.get_pack_size_scaling()
var wave_multiplier = 1.0 + (current_wave_level - 1) * wave_scaling
var final_multiplier = level_multiplier * wave_multiplier // + other factors
```

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Event System with Mastery Foundation (2-3 hours) ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Priority

**Goal:** Create PoE-style events using existing SpawnDirector infrastructure with mastery point foundation

**Event Types:**
1. **Breach**: Portal-style waves of enemies emerging over time
2. **Ritual**: Defend objective while enemies attack from all sides
3. **Pack Hunt**: Elite pack (1 rare + 3-5 magic enemies) with superior rewards
4. **Boss Encounter**: Special boss mechanics with unique rewards

**Event Mastery System Foundation:**
```gdscript
# EventMasteryTree.gd - NEW Resource
extends Resource
class_name EventMasteryTree

@export var breach_points: int = 0
@export var ritual_points: int = 0
@export var pack_hunt_points: int = 0
@export var boss_points: int = 0

@export var allocated_passives: Dictionary = {}  # passive_id -> allocated

func is_passive_allocated(passive_id: StringName) -> bool:
    return allocated_passives.get(passive_id, false)

func can_allocate_passive(passive_id: StringName, passive_def: PassiveDefinition) -> bool:
    var required_points = passive_def.get_required_points_for_type()
    var available_points = get_points_for_event_type(passive_def.event_type)
    return available_points >= required_points and not is_passive_allocated(passive_id)
```

**Technical Approach:**
```gdscript
# EventMasterySystem.gd - NEW System for applying mastery modifiers
extends Node

var mastery_tree: EventMasteryTree
var active_modifiers: Dictionary = {}

func apply_event_modifiers(event_type: StringName, base_config: Dictionary) -> Dictionary:
    var modified_config = base_config.duplicate()

    match event_type:
        "breach":
            if mastery_tree.is_passive_allocated("breach_density_1"):
                modified_config["monster_count"] *= 1.25  # +25% monsters
            if mastery_tree.is_passive_allocated("breach_duration_1"):
                modified_config["duration"] += 3.0  # +3 seconds

        "ritual":
            if mastery_tree.is_passive_allocated("ritual_area_1"):
                modified_config["circle_radius"] *= 1.5  # +50% area
            if mastery_tree.is_passive_allocated("ritual_spawn_rate_1"):
                modified_config["spawn_interval"] -= 15.0  # -15s between spawns

        "pack_hunt":
            if mastery_tree.is_passive_allocated("pack_density_1"):
                modified_config["rare_companions"] += 1  # +1 magic enemy
            if mastery_tree.is_passive_allocated("pack_rewards_1"):
                modified_config["xp_multiplier"] *= 1.3  # +30% XP

    return modified_config

func _on_event_completed(event_type: StringName):
    # Award mastery points
    match event_type:
        "breach": mastery_tree.breach_points += 1
        "ritual": mastery_tree.ritual_points += 1
        "pack_hunt": mastery_tree.pack_hunt_points += 1
        "boss": mastery_tree.boss_points += 1

    EventBus.mastery_points_earned.emit(event_type, 1)
```

**Event Mastery Passive Examples (PoE Atlas Style):**
- **Breach Density**: "Breaches spawn 25%/50% more monsters"
- **Breach Duration**: "Breaches last 3/5 seconds longer"
- **Ritual Area**: "Ritual circles are 50%/100% larger"
- **Pack Hunt Efficiency**: "Elite packs spawn 15/30 seconds faster"
- **Boss Rewards**: "Boss encounters grant 50%/100% more XP"

### Phase 1.5: Event Mastery Tree UI (1-2 hours)

**Goal:** Create simple UI for viewing mastery points and allocating passives

**Mastery Tree UI System:**
```gdscript
# scenes/ui/MasteryTreeUI.gd - Simple passive allocation interface
class_name MasteryTreeUI extends Control

@export var mastery_tree: EventMasteryTree
var available_passives: Array[PassiveDefinition] = []

func _ready():
    load_available_passives()
    refresh_ui()

func _on_passive_button_pressed(passive_id: StringName):
    if mastery_tree.can_allocate_passive(passive_id, get_passive_def(passive_id)):
        mastery_tree.allocate_passive(passive_id)
        EventBus.passive_allocated.emit(passive_id)
        refresh_ui()

func refresh_ui():
    # Update point displays per event type
    # Update passive button states (available/allocated/locked)
    # Show passive descriptions with current effects
```

**UI Features:**
- **Simple tab interface**: One tab per event type (Breach, Ritual, Pack Hunt, Boss)
- **Point display**: Shows earned/spent points per event type
- **Passive previews**: Clear description of what each passive does
- **Visual feedback**: Allocated passives show as active, locked ones grayed out
- **Respec option**: Allow reallocation for testing/experimentation

### Phase 2: Map Tier Progression with Flow Management (1-2 weeks)

**Goal:** Implement 15-minute map cycles with dynamic difficulty scaling and intensity wave management

**Map Tier System:**
```gdscript
// Enhanced MapLevel.gd
class_name MapLevel extends Node

var current_tier: int = 1
var tier_duration: float = 900.0  // 15 minutes per tier
var tier_timer: float = 0.0

signal tier_advanced(new_tier: int, old_tier: int)
signal tier_scaling_updated(scaling_multiplier: float)

func _ready():
    tier_advanced.connect(_on_tier_advanced)

func _on_tier_advanced(new_tier: int, old_tier: int):
    // Immediate scaling update for all enemies
    var new_scaling = calculate_tier_scaling(new_tier)
    tier_scaling_updated.emit(new_scaling)

    // Trigger tier progression rewards
    EventBus.tier_progression_rewards.emit(new_tier)

# Add intensity wave management
func _calculate_intensity_wave(time_in_run: float) -> float:
    # 3-minute intensity cycles for flow state management
    var wave_position = fmod(time_in_run, 180.0) / 180.0
    var intensity_curve = sin(wave_position * PI) * 0.3 + 0.7  # 0.4 to 1.0 range
    return intensity_curve
```

**Enhanced Dynamic Scaling Features:**
- **Auto-scaling**: Each tier increases enemy stats by configurable percentage
- **New enemy types**: Higher tiers unlock different enemy varieties
- **Better rewards**: Each tier improves drop tables and XP rates
- **Event scaling**: Events become more challenging and rewarding
- **Intensity wave management**: 3-minute cycles prevent fatigue while maintaining challenge
- **Build-responsive pacing**: Different intensity patterns for aggressive vs defensive builds

**Same Map, Scaling Difficulty:**
- **Implementation efficiency**: No need for multiple map assets
- **Consistent experience**: Players learn map layout, focus on scaling challenge
- **Data-driven scaling**: All difficulty curves configurable via MapConfig

### Phase 3: Map Selection & Tier System (1 week)

**Goal:** Implement map selection UI and tier progression infrastructure

**MapDevice UI System:**
```gdscript
// scenes/ui/MapDevice.gd - Hideout map selection interface
class_name MapDevice extends Control

@export var available_maps: Array[MapDefinition] = []
var current_tier: int = 1
var selected_modifiers: Array[String] = []

signal map_run_requested(map_id: StringName, tier: int, modifiers: Array[String])

func _on_launch_button_pressed():
    // Validate tier access via meta progression
    // Create MapInstance with selected configuration
    // Emit map_run_requested for ArenaLoader
```

**ArenaLoader Integration:**
```gdscript
// scripts/systems/ArenaLoader.gd - Scene management and transitions
class_name ArenaLoader extends RefCounted

static func run_map(map_id: StringName, tier: int, modifiers: Array[String]) -> void:
    // Create MapInstance from parameters
    // Handle scene transitions with proper cleanup
    // Apply tier scaling and modifiers
    // Emit EventBus signals for progression tracking
```

**Key Features:**
- **Map Selection**: Choose from unlocked arena themes
- **Tier Selection**: Access tiers based on meta progression
- **Modifier Selection**: Apply difficulty/reward modifiers
- **Scene Management**: Clean transitions between hideout and arenas

### Phase 4: Enhanced Performance-Based Progression with Failure-Forward Design (1 week)

**Goal:** Reward skilled play with faster meta progression and implement near-miss psychology

**Performance Metrics:**
```gdscript
// Performance tracking during map run
class_name PerformanceTracker extends Node

var events_completed: int = 0
var events_available: int = 0
var damage_dealt: float = 0.0
var damage_taken: float = 0.0
var survival_time: float = 0.0
var tier_reached: int = 1

func calculate_performance_multiplier() -> float:
    var base_multiplier = 1.0

    // Event completion efficiency
    var event_efficiency = float(events_completed) / float(events_available) if events_available > 0 else 1.0
    base_multiplier *= (1.0 + event_efficiency * 0.5)  // Up to 50% bonus

    // Survival performance
    var expected_survival = tier_reached * 900.0  // 15 minutes per tier
    var survival_bonus = survival_time / expected_survival
    base_multiplier *= survival_bonus

    // Damage efficiency (dealt vs taken ratio)
    var damage_efficiency = damage_dealt / max(damage_taken, 1.0)
    base_multiplier *= (1.0 + min(damage_efficiency * 0.1, 0.3))  // Up to 30% bonus

    return min(base_multiplier, 3.0)  // Cap at 3x multiplier

# Add near-miss psychology tracking
func record_near_miss_attempt(survival_time: float, tier_reached: int) -> void:
    if survival_time >= 840.0:  # 14+ minutes of 15-minute run
        near_miss_count += 1
        grant_near_miss_bonus(survival_time, tier_reached)
```

**Enhanced Meta Progression Integration:**
- **XP Multipliers**: Performance directly affects meta progression speed
- **Catch-up Mechanics**: Players with low meta progression get bonus XP for good performance
- **Skill Rewards**: Advanced players progress faster even without meta upgrades
- **Near-Miss Psychology**: 14+ minute runs grant special progression bonuses
- **Failure-Forward Design**: Each death teaches concrete strategic knowledge
- **Arena Insights**: Failed runs unlock knowledge about optimal event prioritization

### Phase 5: Meta Progression System (Future - Separate Design)

**Goal:** Design hideout progression that connects to map performance

**Core Concepts:**
- **Between-run progression**: Passive tree, equipment unlocks, character upgrades
- **Performance connection**: Map performance determines meta progression currency
- **Expected failure cycle**: Maps scale beyond current power, failure drives advancement

**Design Requirements:**
- **Failure as progression**: Never feel punitive, always advancing
- **Clear milestones**: Visible progress toward next unlock/upgrade
- **Build enablers**: Meta progression unlocks new in-run build options

## Integration with Existing Systems

### SpawnDirector Integration
```gdscript
// Event spawning builds on existing pack spawning
func spawn_event_pack(event_def: EventDefinition, zone_area: Area2D):
    // Use existing proximity filtering
    // Use existing formation patterns
    // Use existing enemy selection weights
    // Add event-specific rewards and timing
```

### MapConfig Enhancement
```gdscript
// Add event configuration to existing MapConfig
@export_group("Event System")
@export var event_spawn_enabled: bool = true
@export var event_spawn_interval: float = 45.0
@export var available_events: Array[StringName] = ["breach", "pack_hunt", "ritual"]
@export var event_reward_multiplier: float = 3.0
```

### Zone System Leverage
- **Use existing Area2D zones** for event placement
- **Leverage proximity filtering** (300px auto, 500px pack, configurable for events)
- **Build on formation patterns** (circle, line, cluster) for event enemy placement

    var base_xp = performance.tier_reached * 100
    var multiplier = performance.calculate_performance_multiplier()
    var total_xp = base_xp * multiplier

    return {
        "meta_xp": total_xp,
        "event_tokens": performance.events_completed,
        "tier_bonus": performance.tier_reached * 10
    }
```
