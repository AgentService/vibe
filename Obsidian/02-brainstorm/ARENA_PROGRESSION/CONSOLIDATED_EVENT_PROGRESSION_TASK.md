# Consolidated Event Progression Task
*Created: 2025-01-19 | Status: Ready to Start*
*Consolidates: EVENT_SYSTEM_MVP_PLAN.md + MULTI_MIND_MAP_PROGRESSION_AND_EVENTS_V1.md*

## Objective
Implement the first working Breach event with timer-based map progression that builds on your existing foundation while staying future-proof and vibe-coding friendly.

## Vision Alignment
**Core Experience:** "15-minute Risk of Rain-style cycles with PoE Atlas mastery progression"
- Timer-based difficulty scaling (not progress bars)
- Event mastery passives modify event behavior
- Performance-based meta progression
- "Just one more run" psychology through near-miss rewards

## Current Foundation ✅
Your architecture is solid and ready:
- **SpawnDirector**: Event spawning infrastructure complete (`_handle_event_spawning`, `_spawn_event_at_zone`)
- **EventMasterySystem**: 25 breach passives, progression tracking, modifier application
- **MapLevel**: Timer-based scaling (60s intervals), perfect for Risk of Rain pacing
- **MapConfig**: Event configuration, spawn intervals, available event types
- **Event Definitions**: `breach_basic.tres` with base configuration

## Implementation: First Breach Event

### Phase 1: Core Breach Mechanics (1-2 hours)
**Goal:** Get one breach event working end-to-end

#### 1.1 Event Instance Tracking
```gdscript
# EventInstance.gd - Simple event state tracking
extends RefCounted
class_name EventInstance

var event_type: StringName
var zone: Area2D
var start_time: float
var duration: float
var spawned_enemies: Array[String] = []
var phase: Phase = Phase.SPAWNING

enum Phase { SPAWNING, ACTIVE, COMPLETED, EXPIRED }
```

#### 1.2 Breach Event Logic Enhancement
**Modify existing SpawnDirector._spawn_event_at_zone():**
- Track event instances in `active_events`
- Implement wave spawning over time (not all at once)
- Apply mastery modifiers from EventMasterySystem
- Simple completion: all waves spawned + zone cleared

#### 1.3 Visual Feedback (Minimal MVP)
- Colored circle at event zone (use existing UI systems)
- Event timer countdown near zone
- HUD notification: "Breach Active" with timer

### Phase 2: Timer-Based Progression Integration (30 minutes)
**Goal:** Connect to MapLevel for Risk of Rain-style scaling

#### 2.1 MapLevel Integration
- Event spawn frequency scales with `MapLevel.current_level`
- Event difficulty/rewards scale with map tier
- 15-minute cycles create natural intensity waves

#### 2.2 Performance Tracking
- Fast event completion = bonus mastery points
- Track efficiency for meta progression
- Connect to existing performance systems

### Phase 3: Mastery System Integration (30 minutes)
**Goal:** Ensure mastery passives visibly affect events

#### 3.1 Passive Application
- Duration modifiers work correctly
- Reward multipliers apply to XP
- Visual feedback when passives are active

#### 3.2 Point Progression
- 1 mastery point per event completion
- Points unlock more powerful passives
- Save/load persistence works

## Success Criteria

### MVP Requirements
- [ ] Breach events spawn every 45 seconds (configurable via MapConfig)
- [ ] Events spawn waves over 25-second duration (not instant)
- [ ] Event completion awards 1 mastery point automatically
- [ ] At least 3 breach mastery passives visibly affect event behavior
- [ ] Events scale with MapLevel.current_level (timer-based)
- [ ] Visual indicator shows event location and progress
- [ ] No interference with existing auto/pack spawning

### Future-Proof Architecture
- [ ] EventInstance system supports adding ritual/pack_hunt/boss later
- [ ] SpawnDirector event logic easily extensible
- [ ] Visual system can handle multiple simultaneous events
- [ ] Performance tracking ready for meta progression expansion

## File Touch Strategy (Vibe-Friendly)

### Minimal File Changes
**Modify (enhance existing):**
- `scripts/systems/SpawnDirector.gd` - Enhance `_spawn_event_at_zone()` for wave spawning
- `scripts/systems/EventMasterySystem.gd` - Add `get_active_modifiers()` method
- `autoload/EventBus.gd` - Add event lifecycle signals if needed

**Create (only if necessary):**
- `scripts/systems/EventInstance.gd` - Simple event state tracking
- `scenes/ui/EventIndicator.tscn` - Minimal visual feedback (if existing UI insufficient)

### Avoid Creating
- Complex event management systems
- Separate event controllers
- Elaborate UI systems
- New autoloads or singletons

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Wave Spawning Enhancement
```gdscript
# In SpawnDirector._spawn_event_formation()
# Instead of spawning all enemies at once:
var waves = calculate_wave_distribution(monster_count, event_def.duration)
for wave_data in waves:
    spawn_wave_after_delay(wave_data.enemies, wave_data.delay)
```

### Mastery Integration
```gdscript
# In EventMasterySystem.apply_event_modifiers()
# Ensure modifiers are applied before event spawning:
var modified_config = mastery_system.apply_event_modifiers(event_def)
event_instance.duration = modified_config.get("duration", event_def.duration)
```

### MapLevel Scaling
```gdscript
# Scale event properties based on map level:
var level_multiplier = MapLevel.get_scaling_factor(0.1)  # 10% per level
event_spawn_interval *= (1.0 / level_multiplier)  # Faster spawning
event_rewards *= level_multiplier  # Better rewards
```

## Future Extensions (Not MVP)
- **Multi-Event System**: 2-3 simultaneous events with strategic choices
- **Event Chains**: Completing breach unlocks ritual in same area
- **Advanced Visuals**: Portal effects, particle systems
- **Meta Progression**: Equipment unlocks, passive tree expansion
- **Seasonal Events**: Time-limited special events

## Next Steps After Breach MVP
1. **Ritual Event**: Defend objective variation
2. **Pack Hunt Event**: Elite pack with special composition
3. **Boss Event**: Mini-boss encounter with unique mechanics
4. **Multi-Event Choice System**: Strategic decision-making under time pressure

## FOLLOW-UP TASK: Breach Spawn Behavior Refinement
*Added: 2025-09-20 | Priority: High | Estimated: 1-2 hours*

### Issue Analysis
Current breach system has phantom position implementation working, but spawn behavior needs refinement:

1. **Edge Spawning Preference**: Enemies should spawn more at breach circle edges rather than center clustering
2. **Max Radius Issues**: Current max_radius (600px) may be too large for effective gameplay
3. **Multi-Breach Enemy Limits**: Each breach should have independent enemy count limits rather than sharing global pool

### Required Improvements

#### 1. Adjust Spawn Distribution (30 minutes)
**Problem**: Phantom positions may still cluster toward center
**Solution**: Enhance `_generate_zone_distributed_positions()` in BreachEventHandler.gd
- **For Circular Zones**: Weight positions toward 70-90% of radius (edge preference)
- **For Rectangular Zones**: Avoid center 30% area, prefer outer perimeter regions
- **Distance Validation**: Ensure minimum 40px separation between phantom positions

#### 2. Optimize Max Radius Configuration (15 minutes)
**Problem**: max_radius = 600px may be too large for arena gameplay
**Investigation Required**:
- Test optimal radius range (200-400px) for different arena sizes
- Ensure breach circles don't overlap with arena boundaries
- Balance player navigation vs threat coverage

**Files to modify**:
- `data/balance/breach_event_config.tres` - Adjust max_radius value
- Test in UnderworldArena.tscn to verify visual scale

#### 3. Independent Breach Enemy Limits (45 minutes)
**Problem**: Multiple breaches may interfere with each other's enemy spawning
**Solution**: Implement per-breach enemy tracking system

**Architecture Changes**:
```gdscript
# EventInstance.gd - Add per-breach limits
var max_active_enemies: int = 15  # Per breach limit (not global)
var active_enemy_count: int = 0   # Track current revealed enemies

# BreachEventHandler.gd - Respect per-breach limits
func _reveal_enemies_in_expanding_circle(breach_event: EventInstance):
    # Skip revealing if breach already at capacity
    if breach_event.active_enemy_count >= breach_event.max_active_enemies:
        return
```

**Benefits**:
- 3 simultaneous breaches = 45 total enemies (15 each) vs current 50 shared
- Each breach operates independently without interference
- Better performance scaling with multiple active events
- Cleaner enemy cleanup per breach

#### 4. Enhanced Multi-Breach Testing (30 minutes)
**Validation Requirements**:
- [ ] 3 simultaneous breaches can spawn without interference
- [ ] Each breach respects its own 15-enemy limit
- [ ] Edge-weighted spawning creates better threat distribution
- [ ] Optimized radius creates appropriate gameplay pressure
- [ ] Cleanup properly removes per-breach enemies on shrinking

### Implementation Priority
1. **High**: Per-breach enemy limits (prevents interference)
2. **High**: Edge-weighted spawn distribution (improves gameplay feel)
3. **Medium**: Max radius optimization (balance/testing)
4. **Low**: Enhanced visual feedback for multiple breaches

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Multiple breaches operate with independent enemy pools
- [ ] Enemy spawning favors breach circle edges over center
- [ ] Optimal breach radius for arena gameplay (200-400px range)
- [ ] No cross-breach interference in enemy spawning/cleanup
- [ ] Smooth scaling from 1-3 simultaneous breaches

This refinement maintains the excellent phantom position architecture while addressing spawn distribution and multi-breach independence for optimal gameplay experience.
