# UI Architecture Overview

## Current Implementation Status

The current UI architecture has **partially evolved** from the original plan but still has areas for improvement. Here's the comprehensive analysis:

## Scene Hierarchy (Current State)

```
Main.tscn (Entry Point)
└── Arena.tscn (Game Scene)
    ├── MultiMeshInstance2D nodes (Rendering)
    ├── Player.tscn (Player Logic)
    └── UILayer (CanvasLayer) - **IMPLEMENTED**
        ├── HUD.tscn (Game HUD)
        └── CardPicker.tscn (Modal Overlay)
```

## Key Systems

### ✅ Implemented Features

- **[[Scene Separation]]**: UI is properly separated into a `CanvasLayer`
- **[[Modal System]]**: `CardPicker` works as modal overlay with game pause
- **[[Event-Driven UI]]**: Uses `EventBus` for communication between systems
- **[[Deterministic Architecture]]**: Follows 30Hz combat step pattern
- **[[MultiMesh Rendering]]**: High-performance rendering for game elements

### ❌ Missing from Original Plan

- **No Main Menu**: Still directly loads into Arena
- **No Scene Manager**: No centralized scene transition system
- **No UI State Management**: No centralized UI visibility control
- **No Responsive Layout System**: UI positioning is fixed
- **No UI Layer Prioritization**: Only basic CanvasLayer usage

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Strengths
1. **Signal-Based Communication**: Proper use of `EventBus` (line 61+ in Arena.gd)
2. **UI Separation**: UI exists in its own `CanvasLayer` (line 215 in Arena.gd)
3. **Modal Implementation**: CardPicker properly pauses game via `RunManager.pause_game(true)` (line 228)
4. **Performance Conscious**: Uses MultiMesh for high-count rendering

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Monolithic Arena Scene**: Arena.gd handles too many responsibilities (378 lines)
2. **Direct Scene Dependencies**: Arena directly instantiates UI scenes (lines 7-8)
3. **No Centralized UI Manager**: No single point of UI control
4. **Limited Scene Transitions**: Only has Main → Arena flow
