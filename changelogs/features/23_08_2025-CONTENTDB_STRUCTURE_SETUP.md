# ContentDB Structure Setup

**Date**: 2025-08-23  
**Type**: Architecture Enhancement  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  

## Summary

Established ContentDB directory structure to clarify architectural intent and prepare for future content system unification.

## Changes Made

### Directory Structure Created
- Created `/data/content/` as ContentDB root with comprehensive README
- Moved existing enemies from `/data/enemies/` → `/data/content/enemies/`  
- Added future content type directories with documentation:
  - `abilities/` - Skill and ability definitions (future)
  - `items/` - Equipment and loot definitions (future)
  - `heroes/` - Player class definitions (future)
  - `maps/` - Level layout definitions (future)

### Code Updates
- Updated `EnemyRegistry.gd` to use new path: `res://data/content/enemies/`
- All existing functionality preserved

### Documentation Added
- Main ContentDB README explaining philosophy vs BalanceDB
- Individual README in each content type directory explaining:
  - Implementation status and future plans
  - Planned schemas and features
  - Integration with other systems
- Updated ContentDB Architecture Enhancement task document

## Architecture Benefits

### Clear Mental Model
- **ContentDB** (`/data/content/`) = Things you add (enemy types, abilities, items)
- **BalanceDB** (`/data/balance/`) = Numbers you tweak (damage multipliers, spawn rates)

### Future-Ready Structure  
- Any AI or developer can immediately understand where content belongs
- No future directory restructuring needed when implementing new content types
- Clear documentation of planned features and schemas

### Development Experience
- Hot-reload support planned for all content types
- Unified loading patterns across content types
- Schema validation and fallback support

## Testing
- ✅ Godot loads without errors after restructure
- ✅ Enemy files accessible in new location
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing systems

## Next Steps
1. Implement actual ContentDB autoload (Phase 1)
2. Extract EnemyRegistry logic to ContentDB  
3. Add schema validation and hot-reload support
4. Expand to other content types as features are developed

**Impact**: Foundation for unified content management system with clear architectural intent
