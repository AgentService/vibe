# Enemy Radar System Implementation

## Date & Context
**Date:** August 11-17, 2025  
**Context:** Replaced broken minimap with a functional enemy radar system for better combat awareness.

## What Was Done
- **Enemy Radar System**: Replaced broken minimap with Panel-based enemy radar showing enemy positions within 1500 unit range
- **Distance-based dot sizing**: Enemy dots scale based on distance for better spatial awareness
- **Always visible positioning**: Top-right corner placement for consistent UI experience
- **JSON Configuration Migration**: Converted hardcoded @export values to JSON-based configuration in `/vibe/data/ui/radar.json`
- **Hot-reload Support**: F5 key reloads radar settings instantly for balance iteration without recompilation
- **BalanceDB Integration**: Added UI configuration loading with proper fallback handling and schema documentation

## Technical Details
- **Architecture**: Panel-based UI component with CanvasLayer rendering
- **Configuration**: JSON-driven settings in `/vibe/data/ui/radar.json` following Decision 2C
- **Data Integration**: BalanceDB autoload manages UI configuration loading
- **Performance**: Efficient distance calculations with range-based culling
- **Key Files Modified**:
  - `vibe/scenes/ui/EnemyRadar.gd` - Main radar implementation
  - `vibe/data/ui/radar.json` - Configuration schema
  - `autoload/BalanceDB.gd` - UI configuration loading

## Testing Results
- ✅ Enemy positions accurately displayed within 1500 unit range
- ✅ Distance-based dot sizing working correctly
- ✅ F5 hot-reload functionality verified
- ✅ JSON configuration fallback handling tested
- ✅ Panel visibility maintained during game pause
- ✅ No performance impact on combat systems

## Impact on Game
- **Player Experience**: Significantly improved spatial awareness during combat
- **Development Workflow**: Hot-reload capability enables rapid UI iteration
- **Architecture Compliance**: Follows project's JSON-first content rule (Decision 2C)
- **Future Extensibility**: JSON configuration enables easy balance adjustments

## Next Steps
- Consider adding radar range indicators
- Implement enemy type differentiation (colors/shapes)
- Add radar fade-out for distant enemies
- Integrate with theme system for visual consistency
