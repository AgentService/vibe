# Hideout System Complete Implementation
**Date**: September 6, 2025  
**Feature**: Complete Hideout Hub System with Scene Transitions  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Commits**: Multiple across hideout implementation phases

---

## Date & Context

**Implementation Timeline**: August 2025 - September 6, 2025  
**Context**: Created a complete hideout hub system as the central navigation point for the game, replacing the previous arena-only workflow. This enables proper separation of concerns between combat (Arena) and progression/navigation (Hideout), setting the foundation for future expansion features like character upgrades, equipment, and map selection.

**Why This Was Needed**: 
- Previous game flow went directly to arena without a central hub
- No unified scene transition system for navigating between different game modes
- Player spawning was inconsistent across scenes
- Configuration system was JSON-based instead of Godot's native .tres resources

---

## What Was Done

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (August 2025)
- **PlayerSpawner System**: Created unified `scripts/systems/PlayerSpawner.gd` for consistent player instantiation across all scenes
- **Resource-Based Config**: Migrated from debug.json to debug.tres using typed DebugConfig resource class
- **Spawn Points**: Added PlayerSpawnPoint markers to both Arena and Hideout scenes with fallback mechanisms
- **Scene Integration**: Both Hideout.gd and refactored Arena.gd use PlayerSpawner system

### Phase 2: Scene Transition System (August 2025)
- **SceneTransitionManager**: Created comprehensive `scripts/systems/SceneTransitionManager.gd` for runtime scene loading/unloading
- **MapDevice Interaction**: Interactive portals with Area2D proximity detection and UI prompts for seamless navigation
- **EventBus Integration**: Added `request_enter_map` and `request_return_hideout` signals for coordinated transitions
- **Main.gd Integration**: Enhanced to work with SceneTransitionManager for smooth scene changes
- **Bidirectional Flow**: Complete Hideout ↔ Arena transitions (E key to enter, H key to return)
- **State Preservation**: Character data maintained across scene transitions

### Phase 3: Enemy Leak Fix (September 2025)
- **Arena Root Container**: Added ArenaRoot node for proper enemy ownership (prevents leakage to autoloads)
- **Teardown Contracts**: Implemented on_teardown() methods with comprehensive cleanup for all systems
- **System Reset Methods**: Added stop() and reset() to WaveDirector, clear()/reset() to EntityTracker
- **Global Safety Net**: EventBus.mode_changed signal triggers fail-safe purge of arena_owned/enemies groups
- **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed entity count reporting and leak detection for diagnostics
- **Test Coverage**: Added `tests/test_scene_swap_teardown.gd` for automated validation

### Phase 0: Boot Switch & Type Safety (September 6, 2025)
- **Typed EventBus Signals**: Added `enter_map_requested(StringName)` and `character_selected(StringName)` with past-tense naming
- **StringName Migration**: Updated DebugConfig.character_id to use StringName for type consistency
- **Hideout Structure**: Enhanced scene with YSort node and renamed spawn point to "spawn_hideout_main" 
- **MapDevice as Area2D**: Converted from Node2D to Area2D with proper collision and typed signal emission
- **PlayerSpawner API**: Added `spawn_at(root, spawn_name)` method with deferred spawn for race condition safety
- **Architecture Documentation**: Updated ARCHITECTURE_QUICK_REFERENCE.md with signal patterns and boot config

## Technical Details

### Architecture Decisions
- **Separation of Concerns**: Hideout handles navigation/menus, Arena handles combat
- **Signal-Based Communication**: All scene transitions use EventBus signals to maintain loose coupling
- **Resource-Based Configuration**: .tres files for type safety and Inspector integration
- **Deferred Spawning**: PlayerSpawner uses call_deferred() to avoid race conditions during scene transitions

### Key Files Modified/Created
**Core System Files:**
- `scripts/systems/PlayerSpawner.gd` - Unified player spawning across scenes
- `scripts/systems/SceneTransitionManager.gd` - Runtime scene loading/unloading
- `scripts/domain/DebugConfig.gd` - Typed configuration resource
- `autoload/EventBus.gd` - Added hideout transition signals + Phase 0 typed signals
- `autoload/GameOrchestrator.gd` - Scene transition coordination with proper cleanup

**Scene Files:**
- `scenes/core/Hideout.tscn` - Central hub scene with YSort structure and Area2D MapDevice
- `scenes/core/Hideout.gd` - Hideout scene logic with PlayerSpawner integration
- `scenes/core/MapDevice.gd` - Interactive portal system for scene transitions (Node2D → Area2D)
- `scenes/main/Main.gd` - Dynamic scene loading with SceneTransitionManager integration
- `scenes/arena/Arena.gd` - Enhanced with teardown contract and cleanup methods

**Configuration:**
- `config/debug.tres` - Typed resource replacing JSON config

**Test Coverage:**
- `tests/test_scene_swap_teardown.gd` - Entity leak prevention validation
- `tests/test_debug_boot_modes.gd` - Boot mode selection verification
- `tests/Hideout_Isolated.tscn/gd` - MapDevice signal emission testing

### Signal Architecture
**Existing Signals (Legacy):**
- `request_enter_map(data: Dictionary)` - Detailed transition data
- `request_return_hideout(data: Dictionary)` - Return transition data
- `mode_changed(mode: StringName)` - Global mode switching

**Phase 0 Typed Signals (New):**
- `enter_map_requested(map_id: StringName)` - Past-tense, typed map entry
- `character_selected(character_id: StringName)` - Past-tense, typed character selection

### Performance Optimizations
- **Deferred Operations**: Spawn timing uses call_deferred() to avoid frame-rate dependent race conditions
- **Pool Cleanup**: Proper entity pool clearing during scene transitions prevents memory leaks
- **Signal Cleanup**: Comprehensive signal disconnection in _exit_tree() methods prevents orphaned connections

---

## Testing Results

### Automated Test Coverage (100% Passing)
1. **Boot Mode Tests** (`test_debug_boot_modes.gd`):
   - ✅ Hideout mode loads with correct spawn_hideout_main marker under YSort
   - ✅ Arena mode loads Arena.tscn with proper root node structure
   - ✅ Scene instantiation works correctly for both modes

2. **Scene Transition Tests** (`test_scene_swap_teardown.gd`):
   - ✅ Enemy cleanup: All enemies removed after arena → hideout transition
   - ✅ EntityTracker cleanup: Registry properly cleared with clear()/reset() methods
   - ✅ WaveDirector reset: Spawning stopped and internal state cleared
   - ✅ No entity leakage: arena_owned and enemies groups properly purged

3. **MapDevice Tests** (`Hideout_Isolated.gd`):
   - ✅ Signal emission: enter_map_requested emits correct StringName payload
   - ✅ Area2D functionality: Proper collision detection as Area2D instead of Node2D
   - ✅ Interaction system: _activate_map_device() method works correctly

### Manual Testing Verification
- **Bidirectional Flow**: H key (arena → hideout) and E key (hideout → arena) both work seamlessly
- **No Entity Persistence**: Enemies no longer follow from Arena into Hideout (critical bug fixed)
- **Configuration Toggle**: Boot mode selection via config/debug.tres works correctly
- **Player Spawning**: Consistent player placement at correct spawn points across scenes

### Architecture Validation
- **Boundary Checks**: All pre-commit architecture validation passes
- **Memory Leak Detection**: No resource leaks detected during scene transitions
- **Signal Cleanup**: Proper signal disconnection prevents orphaned connections

## Impact on Game

### Player Experience
- **Central Hub**: Hideout provides a proper "home base" feeling with clear navigation to combat areas
- **Smooth Transitions**: Seamless movement between peaceful hub and intense arena combat
- **No Interruption**: Scene transitions maintain character state and don't break gameplay flow
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear interaction prompts (E key to enter arena, H key to return)

### Development Benefits  
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation allows independent development of hub features vs combat features
- **Extensible Foundation**: MapDevice system can easily support multiple map types (forest, dungeon, boss areas)
- **Type Safety**: StringName usage prevents string literal errors in map/character identification
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive automated testing prevents regressions during future development

### Technical Improvements
- **Resource Management**: Proper entity cleanup prevents memory leaks during extended play sessions  
- **Configuration System**: .tres resources provide type safety and hot-reload capabilities
- **Signal Architecture**: Past-tense typed signals follow modern conventions and prevent coupling
- **Race Condition Prevention**: Deferred spawning eliminates timing-dependent bugs
