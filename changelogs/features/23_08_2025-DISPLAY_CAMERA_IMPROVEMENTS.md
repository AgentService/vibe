# Display & Camera System Improvements

## Date & Context
**Date**: August 23, 2025  
**Context**: User requested improved default screen size and proper camera zoom behavior. Previous setup used small viewport (1152px) with inverted zoom logic that allowed zooming out beyond the default view.

## What Was Done
- **Display Settings Enhancement**: Updated project.godot with production-ready display configuration
- **Camera Zoom Logic Fix**: Corrected zoom behavior to prevent zooming out beyond default level
- **Performance Optimizations**: Added proper VSync, MSAA, and threading settings

### Specific Changes
1. **Viewport Size**: Increased to 1920x1080 (Full HD standard)
2. **Window Settings**: Added proper windowing modes and positioning
3. **Camera Zoom**: Fixed zoom limits to prevent over-zooming out
4. **Rendering Pipeline**: Configured Forward Plus with anti-aliasing

## Technical Details

### Project Settings (project.godot)
```ini
[display]
window/size/viewport_width=1920
window/size/viewport_height=1080
window/size/resizable=true
window/size/mode=2                    # Maximized window
window/size/initial_position_type=1   # Centered
window/vsync/vsync_mode=1            # VSync enabled

[rendering]
renderer/rendering_method="forward_plus"
anti_aliasing/quality/msaa_2d=1      # 2x MSAA
driver/threads/thread_model=2        # Multi-threaded
```

### Camera System Updates (CameraSystem.gd)
- **Default zoom**: 2.0 (maintains original close view)
- **Zoom range**: 2.0 (min/default) to 4.0 (max zoom in)
- **Scroll behavior**: 
  - Wheel up: Always zoom in (2.0 → 4.0)
  - Wheel down: Only if zoomed in beyond default (blocked at 2.0)

### Key Files Modified
- `vibe/project.godot`: Display and rendering settings
- `vibe/scripts/systems/CameraSystem.gd`: Zoom logic corrections

## Testing Results
✅ **Viewport**: Game launches at 1920x1080 in maximized window  
✅ **Camera Default**: Starts at proper close zoom level (2.0)  
✅ **Zoom In**: Mouse wheel up zooms in smoothly  
✅ **Zoom Out Limit**: Mouse wheel down blocked at default level  
✅ **Window Behavior**: Resizable, centered, professional appearance  

## Impact on Game
- **Player Experience**: Larger, clearer view of the arena and combat
- **UI Readability**: Better text and interface scaling on modern displays
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering pipeline for smoother gameplay
- **Accessibility**: Standard resolution support across different hardware
- **Development**: Easier testing with realistic screen dimensions

## Next Steps
1. **UI Scaling**: Test UI elements at different window sizes
2. **Arena Sizing**: Verify arena bounds work well with new viewport
3. **Mobile Support**: Consider additional resolutions for future platforms
4. **Settings Menu**: Add user-configurable display options
5. **Performance Profiling**: Monitor frame rates on lower-end hardware

## Notes
- VSync prevents screen tearing but may cap FPS to monitor refresh rate
- MSAA provides smooth edges without significant performance impact for 2D
- Camera zoom limits preserve the intended gameplay view while allowing tactical zoom-in
- Forward Plus rendering ready for future 3D elements if needed
