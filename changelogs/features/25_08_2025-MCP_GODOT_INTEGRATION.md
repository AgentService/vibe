# MCP Godot Integration - 25/08/2025

## Overview
Integrated the Godot MCP (Model Context Protocol) plugin to enable direct Claude Code integration with the Godot editor. This allows for seamless AI-assisted development workflows within the game engine environment.

## Technical Changes

### Plugin Integration
- **Added**: `gdai-mcp-plugin-godot` addon in `/vibe/addons/`
- **Enabled**: Plugin in `project.godot` configuration
- **Features**: Direct Godot editor interaction from Claude Code

### File Management
- **Added**: Missing `.uid` files for proper Godot resource tracking
- **Committed**: All previously untracked UID files for CheatSystem and test isolation files
- **Ensured**: Proper resource reference integrity across the project

### Development Workflow
- **Enhanced**: AI-assisted development capabilities
- **Improved**: Real-time code analysis and suggestions
- **Streamlined**: Scene and script management through Claude Code

## Architecture Impact
- **Layer**: Development Tools (external to game architecture)
- **Dependencies**: No impact on runtime game systems
- **Integration**: Uses existing Godot plugin architecture

## Benefits
1. **Real-time assistance**: Direct AI guidance during development
2. **Code quality**: Automated suggestions and error detection  
3. **Workflow efficiency**: Reduced context switching between tools
4. **Architecture compliance**: AI understands project structure and constraints

## Files Added
- `vibe/addons/gdai-mcp-plugin-godot/` (complete plugin)
- Various `.uid` files for resource tracking integrity

## Validation
- ✅ Architecture boundaries maintained
- ✅ Memory leak patterns checked
- ✅ Plugin successfully enabled in editor
- ✅ No runtime performance impact
