# Knight Sprite & Player Improvements Implementation

**Date**: August 21, 2025  
**Feature**: Knight Sprite Integration & Player System Enhancements  
**Status**: Complete  
**Session Duration**: ~2 hours  

## Date & Context

Implemented comprehensive player visual and gameplay improvements, replacing the basic ColorRect player representation with a fully animated knight sprite sheet. Added essential gameplay mechanics including health system, dodge roll with invulnerability frames, and death/restart functionality.

**Motivation**: User wanted to test asset integration workflow and add fundamental action-game mechanics (health, dodge roll, death screen) to establish core gameplay foundation.

## What Was Done

### Visual System
- **Knight sprite integration**: 8x8 grid, 32x32px frames from provided sprite sheet
- **Animation system**: Idle, run, roll, hit, death animations with proper frame mapping
- **Scaling**: 2x scale for better visibility
- **Mouse-based facing**: Player sprite flips left/right following cursor position
- **Dodge roll direction**: Roll animation faces movement direction, overriding mouse facing

### Health System
- **100 HP system**: Max health tracking with damage reception
- **Health bar UI**: Centered bottom screen with red styling and gray border
- **Damage integration**: EventBus signal system for damage events
- **Hit/death animations**: Proper sprite feedback on damage/death

### Dodge Roll Mechanics
- **Dash movement**: Player moves in chosen direction (WASD or towards cursor)
- **Invulnerability frames**: Complete damage immunity during 0.3s roll duration
- **Animation sync**: Roll sprite plays for full duration with proper facing

### Death System
- **Game pause**: Automatic pause when HP reaches 0
- **Death screen**: Semi-transparent overlay with "YOU DIED" message
- **F5 restart**: Scene reload functionality with proper state reset

### Enemy Damage System
- **Collision detection**: Circle-overlap testing between enemies and player
- **1 damage per hit**: Consistent enemy damage output
- **Rate limiting**: Maximum one damage per frame to prevent spam

## Technical Details

### Architecture Integration
- **Data-driven approach**: Animation data stored in `/data/animations/knight_animations.json`
- **EventBus pattern**: All damage events flow through centralized signal system
- **Component separation**: Player movement, health, animation systems cleanly separated
- **Performance**: Uses AtlasTexture regions for efficient sprite sheet rendering

### Key Files Modified
- `Player.gd`: Core player logic, health, dodge roll, animation system
- `Player.tscn`: Replaced ColorRect with AnimatedSprite2D, added scaling
- `HUD.gd/HUD.tscn`: Added health bar, death screen, level label positioning
- `DamageSystem.gd`: Added enemy-player collision detection
- `EventBus.gd`: Added `damage_taken` and `player_died` signals
- `knight_animations.json`: Animation frame mappings and timing data

### Import Settings
- **Pixel art optimization**: `texture_filter=0` for crisp rendering
- **Performance settings**: Mipmaps disabled, proper compression

### Frame Mapping
```json
{
  "idle": [0,1,2,3],           // Row 1: 4 frames
  "run": [16-31],              // Row 3+4: 16 frames  
  "roll": [40-47],             // Row 6: 8 frames
  "hit": [48-51],              // Row 7: 4 frames
  "death": [56-59]             // Row 8: 4 frames
}
```

## Testing Results

### Functionality Verification
- ✅ **Sprite animations**: All 5 animations play correctly with proper timing
- ✅ **Movement integration**: Run animation triggers on WASD input
- ✅ **Mouse facing**: Sprite flips left/right following cursor smoothly
- ✅ **Dodge roll**: Space key triggers roll with dash movement and i-frames
- ✅ **Health system**: Takes damage from enemies, health bar updates correctly
- ✅ **Death sequence**: Game pauses, death screen appears, F5 restarts properly
- ✅ **Enemy collision**: 1 damage per contact with proper rate limiting

### Performance Impact
- **Minimal overhead**: AtlasTexture approach maintains frame rate
- **Memory efficient**: Single texture atlas shared across all animations
- **Rendering optimized**: 2x scaling handled by GPU, no performance impact

### Visual Quality
- **Crisp pixel art**: Import settings prevent blurring
- **Smooth animations**: Proper frame timing (0.1-0.25s per frame)
- **Consistent scaling**: 64x64 effective size matches game scale

## Impact on Game

### Gameplay Foundation
- **Action game feel**: Dodge roll with i-frames provides skill-based combat
- **Visual feedback**: Clear damage, death, and movement state indication
- **Player agency**: Dodge roll gives players defensive options

### Development Workflow
- **Asset pipeline**: Established workflow for sprite sheet integration
- **Data-driven content**: Animation timing tweakable via JSON files
- **Modular systems**: Health, animation, movement cleanly separated

### User Experience
- **Clear health status**: Visual health bar with damage feedback
- **Intuitive controls**: WASD movement, Space dodge, F5 restart
- **Game state clarity**: Pause/death/restart cycle works smoothly

## Next Steps

### Immediate Improvements
1. **Animation polish**: Add transition smoothing between idle/run states
2. **Sound integration**: Add audio feedback for damage, roll, death
3. **Visual effects**: Add particle effects for roll dash, damage hits

### System Expansions
1. **Combat depth**: Add melee attack animations using existing sprites
2. **Status effects**: Implement buffs/debuffs that modify stats
3. **Progression**: Tie level system to health/abilities

### Asset Pipeline
1. **More sprites**: Test workflow with enemy/projectile sprite sheets
2. **Animation variety**: Add directional facing for 8-way movement
3. **UI sprites**: Replace progress bars with custom sprite-based UI

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Animation caching**: Pre-generate sprite frames for faster access
2. **Pooled effects**: Add pooled systems for damage numbers, effects
3. **Batch rendering**: Optimize multiple animated entities

**Architecture Notes**: This implementation maintains the project's data-driven, performance-focused approach while adding essential gameplay mechanics. All systems integrate cleanly with existing EventBus architecture and maintain deterministic behavior patterns.
