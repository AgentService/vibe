# PoE-Style Character System Complete Implementation
**Date**: September 7, 2025  
**Feature**: Complete Path-of-Exile Style Character System with Per-Character Progression  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**PR**: [#14](https://github.com/AgentService/vibe/pull/14) - Complete PoE-Style Character System with Enhanced UI and Debug Integration

---

## Date & Context

**Implementation Timeline**: September 7, 2025  
**Context**: Implemented a comprehensive Path-of-Exile-style character system that replaces the previous single global progression with per-character profiles and saves. Each character now has its own name, class, level, XP, and individual save file, allowing players to create and manage multiple characters independently.

**Why This Was Needed**: 
- Previous system had only global progression without character identity
- No way to create multiple characters or switch between them
- Missing character persistence across game sessions
- Lacked proper character selection and management UI
- Debug mode required manual character selection workflow

---

## What Was Done

### MVP Phase: Core Character System
- **CharacterProfile Resource**: Created typed `scripts/resources/CharacterProfile.gd` with id, name, class, level, exp, dates, and progression data
- **CharacterManager Autoload**: Implemented comprehensive CRUD operations with character creation, loading, listing, deletion, and persistence
- **Per-character saves**: Individual .tres files saved to `user://profiles/` with unique ID generation and collision handling
- **PlayerProgression integration**: Seamless synchronization between CharacterManager and existing PlayerProgression system
- **EventBus signals**: Added `characters_list_changed`, `character_created`, `character_deleted`, `character_selected` for loose coupling
- **Debounced saves**: 1-second timer prevents IO spam during gameplay while ensuring data persistence
- **Knight/Ranger classes**: Initial character class support with removal of Mage placeholder
- **Save path management**: Automatic `user://profiles/` directory creation with proper error handling
- **Robust validation**: Handles corrupt saves, missing files, and edge cases gracefully

### Post-MVP Phase: Enhanced Character List UI  
- **Dynamic Character List**: Programmatically generated character list showing name, class, level, and last played date
- **Play/Delete Actions**: Individual Play and Delete buttons per character with confirmation dialogs
- **Mode Switching**: Seamless toggle between character list view and character creation mode
- **Context-Sensitive Navigation**: Smart back button behavior (creation → list → main menu)
- **Character Management**: Delete confirmation with character name display and automatic list refresh
- **Enhanced UI Layout**: Reorganized scene structure with `CharacterListContainer` and `CreateNewSection`
- **Focus Management**: Proper keyboard navigation and accessibility improvements
- **Memory Management**: Proper node cleanup with `queue_free()` to prevent memory leaks

### Debug Integration Enhancement
- **Smart Character Selection**: Auto-selects last played character when skipping main menu in debug mode
- **Configuration Options**: Added `character_selection` enum with "auto", "custom_id", "create_new" modes
- **Fallback Creation**: Creates default debug characters when none exist
- **Development Workflow**: Eliminates manual character selection during testing and development
- **Debug Logging**: Clear visibility into character selection process with detailed logging

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Design
- **Resource-Based Persistence**: Uses Godot's native `.tres` format for editor-friendly character data
- **Autoload Pattern**: CharacterManager integrates seamlessly with existing PlayerProgression autoload
- **Signal-Driven Communication**: All cross-system communication via EventBus for loose coupling
- **Debounced I/O**: Timer-based saves prevent disk spam while ensuring data safety
- **Type Safety**: Full typing throughout with `Array[CharacterProfile]` and `StringName` usage

### Character Profile Structure
```gdscript
@export var id: StringName
@export var name: String = ""
@export var clazz: StringName  # "Knight" | "Ranger"
@export var level: int = 1
@export var exp: float = 0.0
@export var created_date: String = ""
@export var last_played: String = ""
@export var meta: Dictionary = {}
@export var progression: Dictionary = {}  # PlayerProgression state
```

### Scene Architecture
- **CharacterSelect.tscn**: Reorganized with proper node hierarchy
  - `CharacterListContainer`: Dynamic character list generation
  - `CreateNewSection`: Character creation UI with class selection
  - `CreateNewButton`: Toggle between modes
- **Dynamic UI Generation**: Character list items created programmatically with proper cleanup

### Debug Configuration
```
# config/debug.tres
character_selection = "auto"        # Use last played character (recommended)
character_selection = "custom_id"   # Use specific character_id field  
character_selection = "create_new"  # Always create new debug character
```

## Testing & Validation

### Automated Test Coverage
- **CharacterManager_Isolated**: 5/5 tests passing
  - Character creation with unique ID generation
  - Character persistence and save/load validation
  - Character listing with proper sorting
  - Progression synchronization with PlayerProgression
  - Character deletion with file cleanup
- **PlayerProgression_Isolated**: Complete progression system validation
- **Architecture Boundaries**: No violations detected
- **Memory Leak Validation**: All checks passed

### Manual Testing Scenarios
- ✅ **Character Creation**: Create Knight "TestKnight", verify unique ID and proper stats
- ✅ **Character Persistence**: Exit game, restart, verify character data preserved
- ✅ **Character Progression**: Level up character, verify XP/level saved correctly
- ✅ **Character List UI**: Multiple characters displayed with correct information
- ✅ **Play/Delete Actions**: Individual buttons work with proper confirmation
- ✅ **Debug Mode**: Auto-selection loads "knight_character" Level 9 with 300/380 XP
- ✅ **Mode Switching**: Seamless navigation between list and creation modes

### Performance Validation
- **Save Performance**: Debounced saves prevent I/O spam during gameplay
- **UI Performance**: Dynamic list generation with proper node cleanup
- **Memory Management**: No memory leaks detected in character operations
- **Load Performance**: Character auto-selection works in <100ms

## User Experience Impact

### Character Management Flow
1. **First Launch**: Automatically shows character creation (no characters exist)
2. **Character Creation**: Enter name → Select class (Knight/Ranger) → Character created and loaded
3. **Subsequent Launches**: Character list with Play/Delete options + Create New button
4. **Character Selection**: Click Play → Character loaded with all progression preserved
5. **Character Deletion**: Click Delete → Confirmation dialog → Character removed and file deleted

### Developer Experience  
- **Debug Mode**: Automatic character loading when skipping main menu
- **Clear Logging**: Detailed information about character selection and loading process
- **Flexible Configuration**: Easy switching between auto-selection and manual character specification
- **Development Workflow**: Skip character selection entirely during testing
